# Image Display Fix - Centered and Balanced

I've fixed the image display formatting to ensure images are properly centered and balanced in the event cards.

## ðŸŽ¯ **What I Fixed:**

### **1. Centered Image Container**
- Added `display: flex`, `align-items: center`, `justify-content: center` to the image container
- Images now center perfectly within the container

### **2. Proper Image Sizing**
- Images use `object-fit: cover` to maintain aspect ratio
- `object-position: center` ensures images are centered
- Added `border-radius: 12px` for rounded corners

### **3. Better Error Handling**
- Added `onError` handler for images that fail to load
- Shows fallback placeholder when image URL is invalid
- Checks for empty or null image URLs

### **4. Improved Fallback Design**
- When no image is provided, shows a centered calendar icon
- Better styling with gradient background
- Properly positioned and sized

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the Fix:**

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for these debug messages:
   - "Event data: [object]"
   - "Event image URL: [url]"

2. **Test Different Scenarios**:
   - âœ… Valid image URL â†’ Should display image centered
   - âœ… Invalid image URL â†’ Should show fallback placeholder
   - âœ… No image URL â†’ Should show fallback placeholder
   - âœ… Empty image URL â†’ Should show fallback placeholder

## ðŸ”§ **If Images Still Show as Code:**

The issue might be that the uploaded "image" is actually a code file. To fix this:

1. **Check the uploaded file**: Make sure you're uploading actual image files (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
2. **Check the file type**: The upload function validates file types, but double-check
3. **Check the URL**: Look in the console to see what URL is being generated

## ðŸ“± **Responsive Design:**
- Images scale properly on all screen sizes
- Maintains center alignment on mobile
- Fallback design works on all devices

## ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Improvements:**
- Rounded corners for modern look
- Subtle shadows for depth
- Smooth transitions
- Professional gradient fallback

The image should now display as a proper centered image instead of code, and the layout should be perfectly balanced!
